Background is an image user is able to pan around. Constraints so user can't move outside image's boundaries.
Image can be changed to different settings and it will still constraint correctly.
Radar with blinking locator. Robot's current status of arms, head, torso and legs.
Legs are damaged for period if river is interacted with due to "water damage".

Three buttons located roughly where items would be located for user to interact with.
Proud of the features of the interactivity of the objects and their information boxes.
Thought the friendly interactivity is a bit different from the normal shooting interactivity.
